Nim's very professional blog

Having a blog either means that you know what you're doing, or you're trying really hard to appear as if you know what you're doing. However, I would like to add a disclaimer that I am very proudly clueless about most things, absorbing information like a sponge. This blog is hopefully just a collection of the things that I have absorbed. When I am older and hence wiser, I hope to pen down an Opinion. My only concern for now is that there isn't much content for each post. Nevertheless, I can still try my darnedest to appear as if I know what I'm doing.
