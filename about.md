# About me

Hello! I'm Nimisha (it means "blink of an eye" in Sanskrit). 
I'm currently a designer for Nextcloud, a free and open source file sharing and collaboration platform. I studied engineering in my undergrads, but towards the end of my degree I found myself drawn to our relationship with technology. I'm interested in designing accessible products, digital privacy, and adoption and maintenance of FOSS products.

## Favourite design resources
- Ethical design manifesto by the Small Technology Foundation is my North Star for equitable design 
- Choosing our preferences is Havoc Pennigton's blogpost against "yeah, we could make that a setting"
- UK Home Office accessibility posters taught me that accessibility is way more than screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Favourite research resources
- Repository of research about design and usability in FOSS software by Jan Dittrich and Victoria Bondarchuk
- Harry Brignull's Twitter thread about weird and wonderful HCI research
